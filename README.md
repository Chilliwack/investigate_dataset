# investigate_dataset

**investigate_dataset** is a data wrangling and rough analysis project of Gapminder World Data

This analysis uses data from Gapminder World which has collected a lot of information about how people live their lives in different countries, tracked across the years, and on a number of different indicators. This analysis will use the following indicators.

* GDP total, yearly growth (gdp_total_yearly_growth.csv) - based on gapminder's GDP per capita, PPP. [data source](https://www.rug.nl/ggdc/productivity/pwt/)

* Govt. health spending per person (international money) (government_health_spending_per_person_international_dollar.csv ) - the average health expenditure per person that has been paid by government entities, expressed in international dollars using PPP (Purchasing Power Parity) [data source](https://www.who.int/gho/en)

* Life expectancy (years) (life_expectancy_years.csv) - the average number of years a newborn child would live if current mortality patterns were to stay the same. [data source](http://gapm.io/ilex)

* Suicides (per 100000 people) (suicide_per_100000_people.csv) - mortality due to self-inflicted injury, per 100,000 standard population, age adjusted. This rate is calculated as if all countries had the same age compostion of the population. [data source](https://ghdx.healthdata.org/gbd-2017)

This project was done as part of [Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002) program.
